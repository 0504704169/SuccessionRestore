**Incomplete, don't use this yet**

Alternative to Cydia Eraser that is much easier to update. Downloads and mounts rootfilesystem DMG for your iOS version. Then moves files from mounted DMG to the main filesystem. Still to be added: automatically erase all content and settings. I'd feel safe using this on iOS 7.0+, it probably works even earlier than that, but I haven't tested it yet. The downloader only supports 10.0.1 and later. If you're on 9.3.5 and older, you'll need to download and decrypt the rootfilesystem yourself unless you happen to be on a device I used for debugging, then the downloader might work.

**How you can help**

If you know how to download files from a url and export the progress to the progressbar in the downloadScreen ViewController, please submit a PR. Also if you know how to erase all content and settings program
